Bioinformatics Algorithms Problem Set

(1)  Frequent Words Problem
Find the most frequent k-mers in a string.

Input: A string containing a sequence and an integer k.
Output: All most frequent k-mers in the input string.

Sample Input: ACGTTGCATGTCGCATGATGCATGAGAGCT,4
Sample Output: CATG,GCAT

(2)  Reverse Complement Problem:
Find the reverse complement of a DNA string.

Input: A DNA string.
Output: The reverse complement of the input string.

Sample Input: AAAACCCGGT
Sample Output: ACCGGGTTTT

(3) Pattern Matching Problem
Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

Input: Two strings, the pattern and the genome.
Output: All starting positions where the pattern appears as a substring of the genome.

Sample Input: ATAT,GATATATGCATATACTT
Sample Output: 1,3,9

Test this with the Vibrio cholerae genome, saved as vibrio_choerae.txt and return all starting positions where ATGATCAAG appears as a substring.
