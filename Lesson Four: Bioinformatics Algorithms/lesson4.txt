Bioinformatics Algorithms Problem Set

(1)  Frequent Words Problem
Find the most frequent k-mers in a string.

Input: A string containing a sequence and an integer k.
Output: All most frequent k-mers in the input string.

Sample Input: ACGTTGCATGTCGCATGATGCATGAGAGCT,4
Sample Output: CATG,GCAT

(2)  Reverse Complement Problem:
Find the reverse complement of a DNA string.

Input: A DNA string.
Output: The reverse complement of the input string.

Sample Input: AAAACCCGGT
Sample Output: ACCGGGTTTT

(3)  Pattern Matching Problem
Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

Input: Two strings, the pattern and the genome.
Output: All starting positions where the pattern appears as a substring of the genome.

Sample Input: ATAT,GATATATGCATATACTT
Sample Output: 1,3,9

Test this with the Vibrio cholerae genome, saved as vibrio_choerae.txt and return all starting positions where the reverse complement of CTTGATCAT appears as a substring. Use your previous algorithm to find the reverse complement, do not solve it manually.

(4)  Clump Finding Problem
Find patters forming clumps in a string.

Input: A string representing the genome, and integers k, L (interval within the genome), and t (number of occurrences of the k-mer).
Output: All distinct k-mers forming (L,t)-clumps in the genome.

Sample Input: CGGACTCGACAGATGTGAAGAACGACAATGTGAAGACTCGACACGACAGAGTGAAGAGAAGAGGAAACATTGTAA,5,50,4
Sample Output: CGACA,GAAGA

(5) Skew Diagram
Give all values of Skew_i for i ranging from 0 to 14. (C receives a value of -1, A and T a value of 0, and G a value of +1; plotting a this representation as a vector yields a line plot representing the ACGT content of a genome.)

Input: A genome.
Output: A plot of the skew diagram.

Sample Input: CATGGGCATCGGCCATACGCC
Sample Output: 0 -1 -1 -1 0 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 -2

(6) Minimum Skew Problem
We can use this Skew Diagram to develop an algorithm for finding the origin of replication in a given genome: it should be found where the skew attains a minimum. 

Find a position in the genome minimizing the skew.

Input: A DNA string representing the genome.
Output: All integer(s) minimizing Skew_i(Genome).

Sample Input: TAAAGACTGCCGAGAGGCCAACACGAGTGCTAGAACGAGGGGCGTAAACGCGGGTCCGAT
Sample Output: 11,24
