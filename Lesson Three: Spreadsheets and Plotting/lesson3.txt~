-- Lesson Three --
The solutions to each of these can be found on the group's Github page: https://github.com/jtyurkovich/python-tutorial

(Keep in mind those are simply my solutions; they are not necessarily the only or best solutions for each problem. -jtyurkovich, 2014)

(1)  Download the file exercises3.xls from the Lesson Three directory. 
(2)  Open the workbook and get the sheet names.
(3)  Print the text from the first column of the first sheet (without the header).
(4)  Read in the colors from the second sheet, and print them in the order they would appear in the rainbow. (Hint: use the third column for the order.)
(5)  Get the (x,y) coordinate pairs from sheet 3 and plot.
(6)  Plot those same coordinate pairs again, but this time associate each point with an ordered color from (4). Save this figure as a *.png.
(7)  Get the data from sheet 4 and create a bar plot with arbitrary error bars, once again using the ordered colors from (4). Save this figure as a *.pdf.
