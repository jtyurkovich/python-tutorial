Problem: 

We are looking for a particular motif (some k-mer) within a genome and are interested in outputing the starting position of all matching k-mers within the genome. However, we are not necessarily looking only for exact matches; we are happy to find any k-mers in the genome that match above a certain threshold (e.g., a 95% match, meaning that 95% of the bases of that stretch of the genome match our motif). 

Solution:

Say we have our sequence:

ACGACGACACGACATCTACGTAGACATGACATCGGCGCATGCGATTATCATAAACG

Then say we are looking for an 8-mer motif, GACACGAC, but we are happy to find a 87.5% match (7/8 positions). What we want to do is "window" the whole sequence using a for loop, looking at each 8-mer individually to assign a binary score to each base within the current window (0 = no match, 1 = match). We can then sum the score for each window (there will be len(sequence) - k windows), and, if that value is greater than or equal to our threshold (7), we count it as a hit. 

You can think of this graphically:

ACGACGACACGACATCTACGTAGACATGACATCGGCGCATGCGATTATCATAAACG   sequence
â€‹GACACGAC                                                   window
00011111                                                   score = 5
ACGACGACACGACATCTACGTAGACATGACATCGGCGCATGCGATTATCATAAACG   sequence
 GACACGAC                                                  window
 00000000                                                  score = 0
ACGACGACACGACATCTACGTAGACATGACATCGGCGCATGCGATTATCATAAACG   sequence
  GACACGAC                                                 window
  11100011                                                 score = 5
...
ACGACGACACGACATCTACGTAGACATGACATCGGCGCATGCGATTATCATAAACG   sequence
     GACACGAC                                              window
          11111111                                         score = 8
...
ACGACGACACGACATCTACGTAGACATGACATCGGCGCATGCGATTATCATAAACG   sequence
                      GACACGAC                             window
                      11110111                             score = 7
...

When you find a hit, you would then just keep track of the starting position of that 8-mer (which is conveniently the indexing variable in your for loop) in another variable, which would be the eventual output of your algorithm (i.e., the starting positions of all these motifs in the genome). (Appropriately adjusting for 0-based indexing, of course, when you then go to use those starting positions.)
